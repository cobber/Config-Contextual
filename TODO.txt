quick git test

2015-03-08  add stress-test for 1000's of convoluted configuration settings

2015-03-08  add simple interpolation of values such as {top_dir}
            question:   what if top_dir has a list of values?
            question:   what if a variable needs to keep {}'s as part of its content?
                        provide an optional flag?
                            thing <subst=<>>:   <top_dir>/thing

2015-03-08  add context expressions
            question: how should complex expressions be ranked?
            question: what about things like [ date >= 2015-01-01 and date < 2016-01-01 ] ?

2015-03-08  add stores for common file formats
            .ini
            .apache xml-like
            .rc (every program is different)

2015-03-08  idea: stores which can save settings from the user MAY also store where the setting was set from,
                    i.e.: a URI which links to a graphical configuration editor perhaps
                    Thus, the 'origin' would tell the user where they can change the setting.

2015-03-08  provide a C-library so that all commands can enjoy the comfort of a common configuration language

2015-03-08  ideally, it should be possible to interrogate and change the configuration of ANY program without
            actually starting the program directly.
            e.g.: it should be possible to determine which settings a program will 'see'.
            However: in-app contexts, such as whether the program is in debug
            mode or not will be harder to emulate accurately.
            It should be easy to add a --configuration (or GUI equivalent) to any application!
